          In this experiment, you will play a car parking game with another participant. Your task is to choose where to park your car, but <strong>each parking spot has a different cost</strong>. Additionally, the cost of the parking spot also depends on where your partner parked:
        </p>
        <p>1. If you and your partner park in the <strong>same spot</strong>, you will pay <strong>a penalty of 30MU.</strong></p>
        <p>2. If you and your partner park in different spots of the <strong>same color</strong>, you will receive <strong>a group discount of 10MU.</strong></p>
        <p>3. The regular price and the discounted price will be written on the parking spot.</p>
        <p>The bonus payment for this experiment depends on your total MU across all rounds in the game. This will be calculated based on this equation:</p>
        <p> <strong>$5 – (total MU you paid)*$0.01 </strong></p>
        <p>In other words, your goal is to <strong>minimize the total MU</strong> you pay in this parking game.</p>
